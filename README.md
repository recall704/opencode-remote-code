# 🌐 Remote Code

[中文](README.zh-CN.md)

An OpenCode plugin that lets AI agents operate remote machines over SSH — with **zero footprint** on the remote side. The remote machine only needs `sshd`; no agent, runtime, or dependency installation is required.

The AI sees nothing different: it still calls `bash`, `edit`, `write`, `read`, `glob`, `grep`, and `apply_patch` exactly as it would locally.

## 💡 Why Remote Code?

I am an analog IC engineer. My daily work relies on the **Cadence IC6.1.7 design suite**, which runs on an aging **CentOS 6 VM**. The glibc version on CentOS 6 is too old to install any modern agent tools — Node.js, Python 3.11+, and most modern CLI tools simply won't run.

I need to use OpenCode on my local Windows host to control that VM — automating design flows, batch-modifying schematic parameters, running simulation scripts. **Remote Code** makes this possible: the AI thinks it is operating local files, but every command actually executes on that ancient VM.

**Not a single file needs to be touched on the VM — only the SSH service must be running.**

| Scenario                      | Pain Point                               | Remote Code Solution            |
| :---------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| Legacy VMs (CentOS 6, RHEL 5) | Cannot install modern agents             | Only needs SSH                  |
| Production servers            | Strict compliance, no installs           | Leaves no trace on remote       |
| Embedded / edge devices       | No package manager, resource constrained | All logic runs locally          |
| Remote Windows hosts          | Just install OpenSSH                     | Single entry point              |
| Ephemeral containers          | Don't want repeated setup                | Connect on demand, zero residue |

## 🔌 Standalone MCP Server

This repository is the **OpenCode plugin** version:
<https://github.com/zz6zz666/opencode-remote-code>

There is also a standalone MCP server version planned for the same GitHub
account:
<https://github.com/zz6zz666/mcp-remote-code>

The two projects share the same zero-footprint SSH motivation, but target
different workflows:

- **OpenCode plugin**: tightly integrated with OpenCode. It overrides native
  tools so the remote machine is fully masqueraded as the agent workspace. The
  runtime environment is remote, and local directories are intentionally not
  part of the agent's normal view.
- **MCP server**: exposes namespaced `remote_*` tools to any MCP client. Local
  and remote work can coexist, so an agent can keep local design notes or lookup
  tables while running remote commands, edits, patches, pulls, pushes, and
  simulations on the SSH target.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **OpenCode** (latest version)
- **SSH daemon** on the remote machine (the *only* remote requirement)

> **Note**:  This plugin uses the pure-Node.js `ssh2` library internally. You **do not** need to install `ssh`, `sshpass`, or `rsync` locally.

---

## 🚀 Installation

Installation is a single-file drop-in: build once, copy one file, restart OpenCode. No `node_modules`, no `package.json`, no `opencode.json` entry.

### 1. Build the bundle

```bash
git clone https://github.com/recall704/opencode-remote-code.git
cd opencode-remote-code

# needs Node.js >= 20 or Bun; `bun install && bun run build` also works
npm install
npm run build
```

`npm run build` emits a **fully self-contained bundle** at `dist/plugins/remote-code.js` — dependencies (including `ssh2`) and the prompt texts are inlined.

### 2. Copy it into place

```bash
# Linux/macOS:
cp dist/plugins/remote-code.js ~/.config/opencode/plugins/

# Windows (PowerShell):
Copy-Item dist\plugins\remote-code.js $env:USERPROFILE\.config\opencode\plugins\
```

That is the entire install. Restart OpenCode and the plugin loads.

> OpenCode auto-discovers **files** matching `~/.config/opencode/plugins/*.{ts,js}` (global) or `.opencode/plugins/*.{ts,js}` (project-level), so the filename alone is enough. Two things that do **not** work: a *directory* such as `plugins/remote-code/` (only files are scanned, never sub-directories) and renaming the bundle to `.mjs` (not matched by the glob).

### Build reference

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm install` | Installs deps incl. the `esbuild` devDependency |
| `npm run build` | `tsc` → `.build/` (staging), then `postbuild` patches tool imports and stages the prompt texts, then `bundle.mjs` inlines everything into `dist/plugins/remote-code.js` and deletes `.build/` |
| `npm run dev` | `tsc --watch` into `.build/` (no bundling) |
| `npm run lint` | `tsc --noEmit` type-check only |

`dist/` is wiped at the start of every bundle step and the staging tree is deleted at the end, so it
holds that single file and nothing else — no per-module `.js`, no `.d.ts`, no source maps, no copied
prompt files.

The bundle is an ESM single file targeting Node 20+. `cpu-features` and ssh2's optional native `sshcrypto.node` stay external — ssh2 requires them inside `try`/`catch` and falls back to Node's `crypto`. The `require`/`__dirname`/`__filename` shims in the banner let it load under Bun *and* plain Node ESM.

## 🎯 Usage

> **Launcher fail-fast note**: if the launcher reports an error, nothing was started — OpenCode never falls back to a local session.

Remote mode is activated **exclusively via environment variables**. OpenCode's CLI does not recognize `--remote*` flags, and plugin options in `opencode.json` are unreliable due to internal caching.

### Launcher scripts

The `launchers/` directory contains ready-made launcher scripts for all major platforms. **We strongly recommend using them** because they solve a session persistence problem: OpenCode binds sessions to the current working directory, so if you launch it from different local folders, your remote sessions appear to "disappear." The launchers automatically derive a stable local session directory from your remote target, ensuring sessions persist no matter where you invoke the script from.

1. Copy the appropriate launcher for your platform to a location in your `$PATH` (or keep it anywhere convenient):

   ```bash
   # Linux / macOS
   cp launchers/remote-opencode.sh ~/bin/remote-opencode
   chmod +x ~/bin/remote-opencode

   # Windows PowerShell
   Copy-Item launchers\remote-opencode.ps1 $env:USERPROFILE\bin\remote-opencode.ps1

   # Windows CMD
   copy launchers\remote-opencode.bat %USERPROFILE%\bin\remote-opencode.bat
   ```

2. Edit the **"User Configuration"** block inside the launcher with your `REMOTE_SSH`, `REMOTE_WORKDIR`, and optional credentials.

3. Run the launcher instead of `opencode` directly:

   ```bash
   remote-opencode
   ```

The launcher will:
- **Fail fast** — before OpenCode starts, it checks that `opencode` is in `PATH`, that the plugin is installed, that `REMOTE_SSH` carries a usable credential, that the host/port is reachable, and that the remote workdir exists. Any failure prints the reason and exits non-zero instead of silently dropping you into a local OpenCode session
- Automatically create and `cd` into a stable local session directory (e.g. `~/.opencode/remote-sessions/host_home_project/`)
- Export the required environment variables
- Launch OpenCode from that stable directory

Every value in the configuration block can also be overridden from the environment, and `REMOTE_SKIP_PREFLIGHT=1` bypasses the checks (`--version` / `--help` skip them automatically).

> The credential check exists because the plugin authenticates through the `ssh2` library, which ignores `~/.ssh/config` and default key files: `REMOTE_SSH` needs an explicit `-i /path/to/key` (or a non-empty `REMOTE_PASSWORD`), otherwise the plugin fails to load with *"All configured authentication methods failed"*.

You can also uncomment the optional **SSH connection pool tuning** variables in the launcher if you need to adjust concurrency for legacy SSH servers.

### Configuration options

| Environment Variable       | Description                                                             | Default                  |
| :------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| `REMOTE_SSH`             | Full SSH connection string (exactly as you would type in your terminal) | *(required)*           |
| `REMOTE_WORKDIR`         | Remote working directory (absolute path)                                | *(required)*           |
| `REMOTE_MIRROR`          | Local mirror root directory                                             | `~/.opencode/mirrors/` |
| `REMOTE_PASSWORD`        | SSH login password                                                      | *(optional)*           |
| `REMOTE_SUDO_PASSWORD`   | Sudo password for remote commands                                       | *(optional)*           |
| `REMOTE_POOL_COMMAND_SIZE` | SSH exec connection pool size (`bash`/`glob`/`grep`)                  | `3`                    |
| `REMOTE_POOL_FILE_SIZE`  | SFTP connection pool size (`read`/`write`/`edit`/`patch`)             | `2`                    |
| `REMOTE_POOL_STAGGER_MS` | Delay between sequential SSH handshakes (ms) for legacy servers       | `0`                    |

If `REMOTE_SSH` is not set, the plugin stays dormant and OpenCode runs normally in local mode.

### Authentication examples

**Key-based auth (recommended):**

```bat
set "REMOTE_SSH=ssh -i C:\Users\me\.ssh\id_rsa user@host"
set "REMOTE_WORKDIR=/home/project"
```

**Password auth:**

```bat
set "REMOTE_SSH=ssh user@host"
set "REMOTE_WORKDIR=/home/project"
set "REMOTE_PASSWORD=mypassword"
```

**Sudo commands:**

```bat
set "REMOTE_SSH=ssh user@host"
set "REMOTE_WORKDIR=/app"
set "REMOTE_PASSWORD=mypassword"
set "REMOTE_SUDO_PASSWORD=mysudopass"
```

The AI can then use `sudo` naturally in `bash` commands without interactive prompts.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1. Local Mirror

Only files the AI actually touches are mirrored locally. The mirror is kept at:

```
~/.opencode/mirrors/
└── user_host/
    └── home_project/
        ├── manifest.json          # tracked file list
        └── home/project/          # mirrored directory tree
            └── src/
                └── main.ts
```

### 2. Path Mapping

All paths visible to the AI are **remote absolute paths**. The plugin translates them transparently:

```
AI sees:     /home/project/src/main.ts
Local path:  ~/.opencode/mirrors/user_host/home_project/home/project/src/main.ts
```

### 3. Sync Engine

File-editing tools (`read`, `write`, `edit`, `apply_patch`) operate on the local mirror and sync via SFTP over persistent SSH connections:

- **Before** a file edit → `pullAll()` ensures the local mirror is up to date
- **After** a file edit → `pushAll()` uploads changes to the remote

Command tools (`bash`, `glob`, `grep`) run directly on the remote via SSH.

### 4. SSH Architecture

The plugin uses the `ssh2` library to maintain connection pools:

- **Command pool** (5 connections): for `bash`, `glob`, `grep` execution
- **File pool** (3 connections): for SFTP file transfers

No external `ssh`, `sshpass`, or `rsync` binaries are required.

| `glob`        | Remote SSH    | none                       | Remote `rg --files --sortr=modified` (fallback to `find + stat`) |
| `grep`        | Remote SSH    | none                       | Remote `rg --json` (fallback to `grep -rn`)                      |
| `read`        | Local mirror  | pull before                | Reads from synced mirror                                             |

| `edit`        | Local mirror  | pull before, push after    | Exact replacement on mirror                                          |
| `apply_patch` | Local mirror  | pull before, push after    | Applies patch on mirror                                              |

## 🔒 Security Boundaries

- **Path containment**: `PathMapper` validates that resolved local paths never escape the mirror root (`../` is rejected).
- **Command safety**: Dynamic arguments to `bash` are passed through SSH without local shell interpolation when possible.
- **Privilege scope**: Remote operations run with the SSH user's permissions — no elevation.
- **Workspace boundary**: Operations outside `REMOTE_WORKDIR` follow OpenCode's native permission confirmation flow.

## ⚠️ Limitations

| Limitation                      | Impact                                                                         | Mitigation                               |
| :------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| Large file first-access latency | First download of a >100 MB file waits for SFTP                                | Subsequent edits use delta sync          |
| No remote LSP                   | No language-server diagnostics for remote files                                | Not required for basic editing           |
| Remote tool dependencies        | `glob`/`grep` prefer remote `rg`, fallback to `find`/`grep`          | Present on virtually all Linux distros   |
| Concurrent edit safety          | `edit` tool has per-file locks; concurrent edits on same file are serialized | `bash`/`glob`/`grep` are stateless |
| Binary files                    | `read` detects binaries by extension + content sampling                      | Use `bash` tools for binary inspection |
| BOM handling                    | UTF-8 BOM is preserved across `read`/`write`/`edit`/`patch`            | Works transparently                      |
